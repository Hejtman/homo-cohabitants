# Homo Nexilis

## Vision of post-human evolution. 
As intellect, knowledge, complexity and density of population grows, certain shifts in our society are inevitable. Thinking that current destructive potential of an individual in big city is high? And what about in decade? Or two on orbit station, or in century on distant colony. The least habitable place we settle, the easier of its depopulation would be.
Yet the social revolution is still the slowest, but it is necessary for further advance even in other areas.
